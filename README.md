# backport

This tool backports the latest commit pointed by <source-ref> on the top of <target-branch> by crating a new branch.
Then it pushes the newly created branch and creates a new PR.

```
Usage: 
backport <source-ref> <target-branch> [-c | --continue] [-l | --local] [-ni | --non-interactive]

Options:

  -c, --continue         Continue backporting after fixing cherry-pick conflict
  -ni, --non-interactive Headlessly creates the PR automatically, without previewing in web browser"
